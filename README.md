# README #

This is my implementation from following the tutorial in the book 
*Build modern, responsive cross-platform desktop applications with Qt, 
C++, and QML* by *Nicholas Sherriff*.

## What should will be developed ##

A quote from the book:

*We will work on will be a **generic client management system**. It will 
be something that can be tweaked and re purposed for multiple 
applications—for a supplier managing customers, a health service 
managing patients, and so on. It will perform common tasks found over 
and over in real-world Line of Business (LOB) applications, principally 
adding, editing, and deleting data.*

*...*

*We will be using a super lightweight implementation of the Model View 
Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. If you haven’t come across MVC 
before, it is primarily used to decouple business logic from the user 
interface. The user interface (View) relays commands to a switchboard 
style class (Controller) to retrieve the data and perform actions it 
needs.*

## Development environment ##

* Windows 10 Professional
* Qt Creator 4.7.0
* Qt 5.9
* C++ - Compiler of Visual Studio 2017
* C++ - Debugger CDB of Windows 10 SDK
